                <p >The Thermal Imaging Camera is my diploma project which was necessary to get my Engineer Diploma (BSc). I got the idea for the project whilst working at Continental where I found that using a TIC (Thermal Imaging Camera) is fast and useful for hardware debugging, especially for power electronics.</p>
                <p >I was given the MLX90621 sensor (actually 2 pcs) by Melaxis as samples for being a student, for which I am very grateful. Therefore, the development begun.
                    After careful consideration, I chose the components and the resulting specifications of the device can be seen below:
                <img class = "center-img" src="../images/TIC/specs.png" alt="Specifications" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>
                <p> One thing that I have omitted from the specifications is the VGA CMOS Camera Sensor, which can be seen in the rendered picture above. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I did not have time to finish implementing this in software, but it is functional from a hardware standpoint (with proper power supplies and clock input). Otherwise, the device is fully functional. At the end of this page there is a video where you can see it working. </p>
                <p>I have designed the PCB in Altium as I have never used it before and wanted to familiarise myself with it as it is seen as a professional tool. Below you can the unpopulated and the populated PCB. I've had them made at Elecrow and they turned out pretty great. I soldered them by hand.</p>

                <figcaption style="text-align: center">Populated PCB</figcaption>
                <p> I have implemented several features for this camera: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ironbow color palette (Similar to what FLIR uses): <img src="../images/TIC/ironbow.png" alt="Ironbow color palette" style="width: 10%; height: auto;"></li>
                    <li>Minimum and maximum temperature selection: Manual or Automatic; Maximizing the usage of the color palette -> Better contrast</li>
                    <li>Save data (.csv) / image (.bmp) to SD Card (the BMP implementation was such a pain to write from scratch)</li>
                    <li>Interpolation: Nearest Neighbour and Bilinear (because the imaging sensor only has a resolution of 16 x 4). The top of two fingers:</li><br>

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Bilinear Interpolation</figcaption><br>
                    <li>Panorama feature: Simply stiches 4 images which the user has to align. Panorama thermal image of my hand:</li><br>

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Panorama Thermal Image</figcaption><br>
                    <li>Serial passthrough using the USB port (There is a USB to Serial IC onboard - CH340g)</li>
                    <li>Desktop application written in electron, so the TIC becomes sort of a thermal webcam by using the serial passthrough</li><br>

                    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Desktop Application written in Javascript using Electron</figcaption><br>
                    <li>Variable LCD brightness via PWM and many minor things (show FPS, select whose pixel temperature to see)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you want to read my whole thesis based on this project I would 1. Be pleasantly surprised 2. Totally send you a copy. Use the contact form for more details, I usually try to reply as fast as possible. Finally, you can see a video of the device below:</p>
